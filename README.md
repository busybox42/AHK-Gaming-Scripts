# AHK-Gaming-Scripts
This is a my AutoHotKey script that I use for various games.  It will likely not make sense to anyone but me.  The general idea though is to use an addon to make an icon appear and if that happens push a button otherwise mash our main attack macro.  

# Warcraft
For WOW I use the addons WeakAuras to make my icons appear under some condition.  I've also found it useful to use the addon Sunn Viewport to get a stable (black) color for me to check.  Most of my checks are, if color is not black then there is an icon from WeakAuras telling me to do something.
