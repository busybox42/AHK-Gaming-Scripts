BUGS AND ISSUES

I = Issue
S = Status of issue

1- I:	Combat Mode only works when GW2 is Fullscreen Windowed.
   S:	This is not a bug, and using current methods, this is the only way to get a crosshair overlay.
        I'm working on a new method.

2- I:   The game runs at a lower frame rate When Combat Mode is on.
   s:   For most users this will be barely noticable if present at all. Although rare some users may have a large performance hit.
        In most cases the script itself doesnt lower frame rate beyond 10%.
        Putting the game in Windowed fullscreen can dip framerate by up to 20%.
