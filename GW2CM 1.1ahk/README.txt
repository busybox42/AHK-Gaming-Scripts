To install:

Install AHK. http://www.autohotkey.com/download/AutoHotkeyInstall.exe


1-  Firstly, you will need to make the following changes in Guild Wars 2:

    In "General Options":
       - Autotargeting: ON
       - Promote Skill Target: OFF
       - Fast-Cast Ground Targeting: ON

    In "Graphics"Options":
       - Resolution: WINDOWED FULLSCREEN

    In "Control Options":
       - UNBIND TAB 
         (tab targeting does not work with Combat Mode)
         (Make sure nothing is bound to to target "next enemy" or "nearest enemy")


2-  Unzip GW2CM 1.1 to where ever you would like
    (Right Click > Extract All...)


3-  Once unzipped, Double Click on "GW2CM.ahk" to start Combat Mode. 
    (If it worked correctly you will see the icon in the notification tray, it may be hidden)
    (Your anti virus may try to prevent the exe from running, this is precautionary)
    (If you dont want to run the exe version then you still get the AHK script version online)


4-  In the "Control Options" bind the following keys:

       - "9"  : Weapon Skill 1                	(left click)
       - "0"  : Dodge                  		(right Click)
       - "x"  : Lock AutoTarget

   (What we give are just suggestions that worked best for us, you can bind whatever you want)
   (To view and edit a full list of keys, as well as edit crosshair settings, open "Settings.exe")
   (Settings can also be changed in game by pressing "Insert" or clicking on the icon in the system tray and selecting "Settings")
       

5- Press Tab to toggle Combat Mode On/Off
   (To turn it off completely, click "Exit" from the icon in the system tray)

NOTE: IF IT DOESNT WORK CORRECTLY TRY RUNNING AS ADMIN
      Make sure you have the latest version of AHK
